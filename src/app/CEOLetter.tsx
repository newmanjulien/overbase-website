                Being a world class Customer Success Manager means knowing
                what's going on with your customers better than everyone else.
                But boy is that hard to do when customer data isn't easy to get
              </p>

              <p>
                The data you need to prepare for your next QBR, to understand
                the health of an account, to make the case for an expansion.
                That data is all over the place, hard to access and often
                outdated
              </p>

              <p>
                You might be constantly querying Posthog to get usage data.
                Checking Pylon and Linear for open tickets. Looking in Gainsight
                to understand the account history. Potentially even begging the
                dev team to help you get some more niche data. Then you might
                need to also double check much of that data because it could be
                outdated
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="font-medium">
                  Why is it so hard to get the data you need?
                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>With Overbase, CSMs can now easily get any customer data</p>

              <p>
                You simply explain what data you need in plain English. Then an
                AI agent quickly and automatically gathers the data in a way
                that's both complete and accurate
              </p>

              <p>
                This AI agent can gather data from all of your platforms and
                tools. It can get structured data from Posthog, Pylon,
                Gainsight, etc. But also unstructured data from Gong, Slack,
                Gmail, Notion, etc
              </p>

              <p>
                And to guarantee the quality of the data, one of Overbase's
                human data scientists always reviews the data which the AI agent
                gathered for you
              </p>

              <p>
                The result is that you get customer data with close to 0 effort.
                And that data is always accurate and complete
              </p>
