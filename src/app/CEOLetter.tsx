                Being good at Customer Success means knowing what's going on
                with your customers better than everyone else. But how can you
                do that when it's so hard to get the data you need about your
                customers?
              </p>

              <p>
                The data you need to prepare for your next QBR. The data you
                need to understand the health of an account. The data you need
                to make the case for an expansion. That data is all over the
                place, hard to access and often outdated
              </p>

              <p>
                You might be constantly querying Posthog to get usage data.
                Checking Pylon and Linear for open tickets. Looking in Gainsight
                to understand the account history. Potentially even begging the
                dev team to help you get some more niche data. Then you might
                need to also double check a lot of that data because it could
                actually be outdated
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="font-medium">
                  What's going on? Why is it so hard to get the data you need to
                  do your job?
                </strong>
              </p>

              <p>
                <strong className="font-medium">
                  And why are you spending so much time trying (and often
                  failing) to figure out what's going on with your customers?
                </strong>{" "}
                Instead of helping customers achieve their goals, strengthening
                your relationships, ensuring renewals and setting the stage for
                expansions
              </p>

              <p>
                With Overbase, you now easily request any Customer Success data.
                Then you quickly get the complete, up-to-date and accurate data
              </p>

              <p>
                Requesting data in a rinse-and-repeat way is simple and
                intuitive with our calendar interface. You can easily schedule
                recurring requests for data which align with customer meetings
                or deadlines
              </p>

              <p>
                Overbase uses all your data from all your platforms and tools.
                Structured data from Posthog, Pylon, Gainsight, etc.
                Unstructured data from Gong, Slack, Gmail, Notion, etc. And we
                check external data to be sure everything is up-to date. For
                example, we'll check LinkedIn to see if your champion changed
                jobs
              </p>

              <p>
                We also have a human in the loop who double checks the data
                before you receive it. That way you always get the highest
                quality results
              </p>
